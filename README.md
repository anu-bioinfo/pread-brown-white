# pread-brown-white
Code/data/output from paired analysis of brown vs. white human preadipocytes from Ramirez et al. The code relies on functions defined in https://github.com/jdreyf/fat-exosome-microrna/tree/master/functions. The gene expression data is also available at the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession GSE100003 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE100003). The output (pread_gene_stats.csv) gives the average of each probeset in each group on the log2 scale, the p-value, FDR, log2FC, fold-change (FC), and probeset annotation.
